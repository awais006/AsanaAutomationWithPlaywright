# Asana Dashboards Verification Automation with Playwright 🚀

This repository contains an end-to-end **Data Driven** test automation framework built using **TypeScript** and **Playwright**. The framework is designed to test and verify projects and tasks in a project management application.

## Features
- **Dynamic Test Generation**: Each project verification is treated as an individual test case.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implements POM for better code structure and reusability.
- **Configurable Settings**: Uses environment-specific configuration for URLs and credentials.
- **JSON-based Data-Driven Testing**: Reads project data from a JSON file for dynamic test execution.
- **Playwright Test Framework**: Supports parallel execution and powerful reporting features.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
